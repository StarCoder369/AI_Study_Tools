# üß† Python AI Toolkit (Local, Offline-Capable)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ollama currently supports macOS, Windows (via WSL2), and Linux. Mobile platforms are not supported.


This project is a suite of AI-powered educational tools that run locally using **Ollama** and the **phi-2** model. It includes:

- ‚úÖ AI Study Timer (with motivational quotes)
- ‚úÖ Flashcard Generator
- ‚úÖ Grammar Checker
- ‚úÖ Quiz Maker
- ‚úÖ AI Concept Explainer

All tools are accessed from a single launcher (`main.py`) and run through a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter. No internet or API keys required.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### 1. ‚úÖ Install Python

Download and install Python 3.9 or higher:  
üîó https://www.python.org/downloads

After installing, verify Python is available:

```bash
python --version
```

If that doesn‚Äôt work, try:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 2. üß† Install Ollama and the phi-2 Model

Download Ollama from:  
üîó https://ollama.com

Install it like any normal app, then **launch Ollama** ‚Äî it must be running in the background.

Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Terminal, or PyCharm's terminal) and run:

```bash
ollama run phi
```

This will download and start the local AI model. **Keep this terminal open** while using the app.
