# üß† Python AI Toolkit (Local, Offline-Capable)
 
 > ‚ö†Ô∏è Ollama currently supports macOS, Windows (via WSL2), and Linux. Mobile platforms are not supported.
 
 
 This project is a suite of AI-powered educational tools that run locally using **Ollama** and the **phi-2** model. It includes:
 
 - ‚úÖ AI Study Timer (with motivational quotes)
 - ‚úÖ Flashcard Generator
 - ‚úÖ Grammar Checker
 - ‚úÖ Quiz Maker
 - ‚úÖ AI Concept Explainer
 
 All tools are accessed from a single launcher (`main.py`) and run through a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter. No internet or API keys required.
