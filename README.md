# 🧠 Python AI Toolkit (Local, Offline-Capable)
 
 > ⚠️ Ollama currently supports macOS, Windows (via WSL2), and Linux. Mobile platforms are not supported.
 
 
 This project is a suite of AI-powered educational tools that run locally using **Ollama** and the **phi-2** model. It includes:
 
 - ✅ AI Study Timer (with motivational quotes)
 - ✅ Flashcard Generator
 - ✅ Grammar Checker
 - ✅ Quiz Maker
 - ✅ AI Concept Explainer
 
 All tools are accessed from a single launcher (`main.py`) and run through a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter. No internet or API keys required.

 ## 🚀 How to Run This Project
 
 ### 1. ✅ Install Python
 
 Download and install Python 3.9 or higher:  
 🔗 https://www.python.org/downloads
 
 After installing, verify Python is available:
 
 ```bash
 python --version
 ```
 
 If that doesn’t work, try:
 
 ```bash
 python3 --version
 ```

 ### 2. 🧠 Install Ollama and the phi-2 Model
 
 Download Ollama from:  
 🔗 https://ollama.com
 
 Install it like any normal app, then **launch Ollama** — it must be running in the background.
 
 Open a terminal (Command Prompt, Terminal, or PyCharm's terminal) and run:
 
 ```bash
 ollama pull phi
 ```
 
 This will download and start the local AI model. **Keep this terminal open** while using the app.
